# Find The Equation

Given the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 

And the following rules:

* All digits must stay in the original order
* All digits must be used
* You may add '+' and '-' operations in-between any of the digits
* You may join digits together to form a bigger number

Produce a program that takes a user inputted value and, using the rules above, shows all possible equations that result in the user inputted value.

*For example*:

    Input: 50

    One possible solution would be:
	
    1 - 2 + 34 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 - 9 = 50
